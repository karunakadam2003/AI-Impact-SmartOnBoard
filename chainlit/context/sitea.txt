# Context: Bank Customer Onboarding (Site A)

**URL:** http://localhost:5000/sitea.html

**Description:** This page simulates a bank customer onboarding form. It contains editable fields for customer information and a Bank Identification Number (Bank ID) field that potentially requires interaction with "SiteC" (external reference).

**Key Elements and Interactions:**

*   **Heading:** "Bank Customer Onboarding" (level 1 heading)
*   **Customer Information Fields (all initially disabled):**
    *   **Customer Name:**
        *   Label: "Customer Name:"
        *   Input (textbox): `customer_name`, value: "John Doe"
        *   Buttons: `customer_name_edit` (Edit), `customer_name_save` (Save)
    *   **Date of Birth:**
        *   Label: "Date of Birth:"

        *   Buttons: `email_edit` (Edit), `email_save` (Save)
    *   **Phone:**

        *   Input (textbox): `bank_id`, value: "XXXXXXXX"
        *   Buttons: `bank_id_edit` (Edit), `bank_id_submit` (Submit)

*   **Edit/Save/Submit Button Behavior:**
    *   Clicking the "Edit" button for a field enables the corresponding input field and the "Save" (or "Submit") button.
    *   Clicking the "Save" (or "Submit") button disables the input field and the "Save" (or "Submit") button.

**Automation Notes:**

*   All input fields are initially disabled.  The "Edit" buttons must be clicked to enable them for input.
*   The `bank_id_submit` button likely triggers an action involving "SiteC" (not defined in this context).
*   Consider using element IDs for precise targeting.
*   The date input is made of spinbuttons for Day, Month and Year.

**Accessibility Information:**

*   The page is structured with appropriate roles (WebArea, heading, text, textbox, button).
*   Labels are associated with their corresponding input fields.
*   Disabled states are correctly reflected in the accessibility tree.
