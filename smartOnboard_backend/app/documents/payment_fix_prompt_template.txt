You are a financial analyst. Analyze the following payment JSON object and check for potential issues as mentioned below. 
Return very crisp reason why the payment failed.

 1. Banking Issues  
- Incorrect Bank Details  
  - Wrong SWIFT code, IBAN, or account number for either the creditor or debtor could cause the payment to fail.  
  - check for validity of IBAN number for creditor and debitor fetched from real time data
  - SWIFT code should always be a 10 character code

- Bank Processing Delays  
  - If the creditor's bank has processing restrictions, check if the paymentdue date has been crossed

- Currency Mismatch or Restrictions  
  - If the debtor's bank only processes domestic payments and this is an international wire, the payment could be held for manual review. Check using billing address and currency

 2. Compliance & Regulatory Issues  
- KYC/AML (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering) Flags  
  - Large payments (greater than 15000$) may trigger an AML check, especially if this is a new transaction between the debtor and creditor.  
  - If one of the parties is flagged for suspicious activity, the payment could be held for further verification.  

- Sanctions or Blacklist Issues  
  - If either the creditor or debtor is on a sanctions list, the payment may be blocked.  
  - Example: If `"tax_id": "US-987654321"` belongs to a sanctioned entity, the bank may freeze the transaction.   

 3. Invoice & Payment Terms Issues  
- Invoice Dispute Between Creditor and Debtor  
  - If ABC Manufacturing Ltd. disputes the invoice (e.g., incorrect charges in `line_items`), they may withhold payment.  
  - Example: The debtor claims the `"Customs Handling Fee"` of `$500.75` is invalid and refuses to pay.  

 4. Technical & System Issues  
- Transaction Processing Limit Exceeded  
  - Some business accounts have a daily transaction limit. Check if debtorâ€™s daily_transaction_limit_crossed has been crossed. 

- Duplicate Payment Flags  
  - If the system detects a similar payment made recently, it adds a flag to the  transaction as a duplicate and prevent processing.  

 5. Manual Review & Approval Delays  
- Multi-Level Authorization Delays  
  - If a particular transaction requires multi-level approval, "manual_approval_required" should be Yes, and then there should be additional field for approver name
